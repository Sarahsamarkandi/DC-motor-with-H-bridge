# DC-motor-with-H-bridge
In the Smart Methods electronics track, my task involves controlling a DC motor using an H-bridge.

**DC Motor**: A DC (Direct Current) motor is an electric motor that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. It operates on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. Key features include:
- **Components**: A DC motor typically consists of a rotor (armature), a stator, a commutator, brushes, and windings.
- **Operation**: When current flows through the windings, a magnetic field is generated, interacting with the magnetic field of the stator, causing the rotor to turn.
- **Types**: Common types include brushed and brushless DC motors. Brushed motors use brushes to conduct current between stationary wires and the rotating armature, while brushless motors use electronic commutation.

**H-Bridge**: An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that allows a voltage to be applied across a load in either direction. It is commonly used to control the direction and speed of DC motors. The name "H-bridge" comes from its typical graphical representation, which resembles the letter "H." Key features include:
- **Components**: An H-bridge consists of four switches (transistors or MOSFETs) that control the direction of the current flow through the motor.
- **Operation**: By opening and closing the switches in pairs, the H-bridge can apply the voltage across the motor in either direction, allowing for forward and reverse operation.
- **Control**: The H-bridge can be controlled using digital signals from a microcontroller (like an Arduino) to adjust motor speed and direction.

**Building a Circuit with Two DC Motors, an H-bridge (HW-95), and an Arduino**:

**Components Needed**:
- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- HW-95 H-bridge motor driver
- Two DC motors
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply (appropriate for your motors)
- Capacitors (optional, to reduce electrical noise)

This task involves setting up and programming the circuit to control the DC motors, allowing for precise manipulation of their speed and direction through the H-bridge driver controlled by the Arduino.
